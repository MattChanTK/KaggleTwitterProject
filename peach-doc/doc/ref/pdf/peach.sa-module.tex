Simulated Annealing is a meta-heuristic designed for optimization of functions.
It tries to mimic the way that atoms settle in crystal structures of metals. By
slowly cooling the metal, atoms settle in a position of low energy -{}- thus, it
is a natural optimization method.

Two kinds of optimizer are implemented here. The continuous version of the
algorithm can be used for optimization of continuous objective functions; the
discrete (or binary) one, can be used in combinatorial optimization problems.

\subsection{Modules}

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\parskip}{0ex}
\item \textbf{base}: 
This package implements two versions of simulated annealing optimization. One
works with numeric data, and the other with a codified bit string. This last
method can be used in discrete optimization problems.


  \textit{(Section \ref{peach:sa:base}, p.~\pageref{peach:sa:base})}

\item \textbf{neighbor}: 
This module implements a general class to compute neighbors for continuous and
binary simulated annealing algorithms. The continuous neighbor functions return
an array with a neighbor of a given estimate; the binary neighbor functions
return a \texttt{bitarray} object.
