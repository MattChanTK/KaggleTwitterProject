\section{Module peach.ga.crossover}

    \label{peach:ga:crossover}

Basic definitions for crossover operations and base classes.

Crossover is a very basic and important operation in genetic algorithms. It is
by means of crossover among the chromosomes that population gains diversity,
thus exploring more completelly the solution space and giving better answers.
This sub-module provides definitions of the most common crossover operations,
and provides a class that can be subclassed to construct different types of
crossover for experimentation.

Base class for crossover operators.

This class should be subclassed if you want to create your own crossover
operator. The base class doesn't do much, it is only a prototype. As is done
with all the base classes within this library, use the \texttt{\_\_init\_\_} method
to configure your crossover behaviour -{}- if needed -{}- and the \texttt{\_\_call\_\_}
method to operate over a population.

A class derived from this one should implement at least 2 methods, defined
below:
%
\begin{quote}
%
\begin{description}
\item[{\_\_init\_\_(self, %
\raisebox{1em}{\hypertarget{id2}{}}\hyperlink{id1}{\textbf{\color{red}*}}cnf, %
\raisebox{1em}{\hypertarget{id4}{}}\hyperlink{id3}{\textbf{\color{red}**}}kw)}] \leavevmode 
Initializes the object. There are no mandatory arguments, but any
parameters can be used here to configure the operator. For example, a
class can define a crossover rate -{}- this should be defined here:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
\_\_init\_\_(self,~rate=0.75)
}
\end{quote}

A default value should always be offered, if possible.

\item[{\_\_call\_\_(self, population)}] \leavevmode 
The \texttt{\_\_call\_\_} implementation should receive a population and operate
over it. Please, consult the \texttt{ga} module to see more information on
populations. It should return the processed population. No recomendation
on the internals of the method is made. That being said, in general the
crossover operators pairs chromosomes and swap bits among them (but
there is nothing to say that you can't do it differently).

\end{description}

\end{quote}

Please, note that the GA implementations relies on this behaviour: it will
pass a population to your \texttt{\_\_call\_\_} method and expects to received the
result back.

A one-point crossover operator.

A one-point crossover randomly selects a single point in two chromosomes and
swaps the bits among them from that point until the end of the bit stream.
The crossover rate is the probability that two paired chromosomes will
exchange bits.

Proceeds the crossover over a population.

In one-point crossover, chromosomes from a population are randomly
paired. If a uniform random number is below the \texttt{rate} given in the
instantiation of the operator, then a random point is selected and bits
from that point until the end of the chromosomes are exchanged.
