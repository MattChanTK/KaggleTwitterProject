- The specification of the Acceleration method in PSO needs a reference to the
  swarm. This doesn't allow configuration in the creation of the swarm. A
  different method to specify the reference to the swarm must be developed.

- It might be useful that, in population methods, the signature of the
  intialization is:

  Algorithm(f, x0, ranges, format, ...)

  Such that, in every algorithm, the first parameter is the objective function,
  the second is the population of estimates, the third is the ranges. Since not
  all methods implement the format, it can be put later, so the first three
  parameters are standardized.
