# Defuzzification methods

# We import numpy for arrays and peach for the library. Actually, peach also
# imports the numpy module, but we want numpy in a separate namespace:
import numpy
from peach.fuzzy import *


# The main application of fuzzy logic is in the form of fuzzy controllers. The
# last step on the control is the defuzzification, or returning from fuzzy sets
# to crisp numbers. Peach has a number of ways of dealing with that operation.
# Here we se how to do that.


# Just to illustrate the method, we will create arbitrary fuzzy sets. In a
# controller, these functions would be obtained by fuzzification and a set of
# production rules. But our intent here is to show how to use the
# defuzzification methods. Remember that instantiating Membership functions
# gives us a function, so we must apply it over our domain.
y = numpy.linspace(-30.0, 30.0, 500)
gn = Triangle(-30.0, -20.0, -10.0)(y)
pn = Triangle(-20.0, -10.0, 0.0)(y)
z = Triangle(-10.0, 0.0, 10.0)(y)
pp = Triangle(0.0, 10.0, 20.0)(y)
gp = Triangle(10.0, 20.0, 30.0)(y)

# Here we simulate the response of the production rules of a controller. In it,
# a controller will associate a membership value with every membership function
# of the output variable. Here we do that. You will notice that no membership
# values are associated with pp and gp functions. That is because we are
# supposing that they are 0, effectivelly eliminating those functions (we plot
# them anyway.
mf = gn & 0.33 | pn & 0.67 | z & 0.25

# Here are the defuzzification methods. Defuzzification methods are functions.
# They receive, as their first parameter, the membership function (or the fuzzy
# set) and as second parameter the domain of the output variable. Every method
# works that way -- and if you want to implement your own, use this signature.
# Notice that it is a simple function, not a class that is instantiated.
centroid = Centroid(mf, y)                 # Centroid method
bisec = Bisector(mf, y)                    # Bissection method
som = SmallestOfMaxima(mf, y)              # Smallest of Maxima
lom = LargestOfMaxima(mf, y)               # Largest of Maxima
mom = MeanOfMaxima(mf, y)                  # Mean of Maxima

# We will use the matplotlib module to plot these functions. We save the plot in
# a figure called 'defuzzification.png'.
